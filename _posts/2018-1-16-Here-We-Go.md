title: How did I end up here?
---

How did I end up at Metis? Never in a million years did I think I would be partaking in a bootcamp, let alone a Data Science one. Just my first week in and I'm already very behind... They aren't kidding about the workload, but the one thing that gives me a glimmer of hope is the effort that my classmates are putting in, their intelligence and their drive.

My goals for the first month of this bootcamp

#### Month 1

* Sleep 8 Hours a day
* Be at a point where you're ahead of the game, rather than behind the game
* Utilize the TAs, at least 1 question a day
* Create a Personal Github Repo and start pushing Metis projects to that to begin showcasing to the outside world
